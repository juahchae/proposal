# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Typing Masterclass 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that allows people to learn how to type quickly and efficiently. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will test the user's typing speed. It will feature the user's words per minute (WPM). 
When the user enters the test, they will be introduced with a "Welcome" and "Press any key to begin." 
When the user presses a key, they will be given 100 characters with capital and lowercase letters and punctuation marks. 
The sentence(s) will be in gray color. If they type the correct characters, it will turn white. If they type incorrectly, it will turn red.
When they finish the sentence(s), the results, specifically WPM, will be shown. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- Green character for correct characters
- Red character for incorrect characters
- Results will display the user's words per minute

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Accuracy feature

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Timer feature (User can choose between 15 seconds, 30 seconds, and 1 minute)

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Because I want to change the colors of the characters, white for correct and red for incorrect, I need white or red characters to go over the gray characters. If the player presses the wrong character and wants to delete it, I need the program to delete the character, instead of moving the cursor backwards. 
I might need to download pygame library. I might to learn curses programming in python. Also, I need transfer a list of sentences for the player to have random sentences from the list.
